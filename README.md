I use React JS build a site that displays information from the TV show Rick and Morty. I used React to essentially consume a Rick and Morty API and set three different navlinks(Characters, Locations, and Episodes) to display the respected data for each link. I mostly only used JavaScript XML. Ultimately I was not able to display the data on any navlinks, I could find out what exactly I was doing wrong.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
